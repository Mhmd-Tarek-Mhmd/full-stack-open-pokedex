# Exercise 1

- **Some common steps in a CI setup include linting, testing, and building. What are the specific tools for taking care of these steps in the ecosystem of the language you picked?**

  For JavaScript/Node.js:
  - **Linting:**  *ESLint*
  - **Testing:**  *Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine*
  - **Building:** *Webpack, Parcel, or Rollup*

- **What alternatives are there to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions?**

  *Alternatives include GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI, CircleCI, Bitbucket Pipelines, Azure DevOps, and TeamCity.*

- **Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? Why? What information would you need to make that decision?**

  *Cloud-based environments are generally easier to maintain, scale, and integrate with other services. Self-hosted environments offer more control and customization but require more resources and maintenance. To decide, you need information about budget, security requirements, scalability needs, team expertise, and integration needs.*
